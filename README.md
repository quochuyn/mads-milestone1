# Description
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted much of the global supply chain. In particular, we wish to investigate its impact on the USâ€™s agricultural truck transportation supply chain and the price/volume of certain agricultural products. For example, we want to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 cases, truck volume, and agricultural product pricing in the state of California.
